			<div class="text"><p>The final push</p><p>I have made the final changes to my game! the hyperactive super moose shooting ufos from the forest! I've added a great infectious tune in the back to get you more into the game.
			However If I planned my time correct I would have done a lot more, unfortunately due to working full time at <a href="http://ascesismedia.com">Ascesis</a> designing and developing it's left me without a lot of time to work on this project.</P>
			<p>The Javascript knowledge I have is very Limited, as I focus mailnly on HTML and CSS as well as A lot of Design work.</p>
