			<div class="text"><p>A quick look into learning Git on Windows</p><p>To get to grips with Git I downloaded Git Bash, a way to access Git through command line on windows PC's, with this I created a folder called MooseInvaders. This is where all the stuff I upload will go to, the game and the complimentary site I built alongside it.</p><p> I used several commands to set up my Git Repo and these were <span class="code">$git init</span> to start up the git repo locally then <span class="code">$git add .</span> which added all the files that were currently in the folder I initialised git in.</p>
				<p>Once all the file were added the next step was to check the status <span class="code">$git status</span> which showed if files needed to be committed, which all files were so I committed the files <span class="code">$git commit -am "first commit"</span> this locally committed all files to the repo</p> <p>What next? Uploading to the online repo on github itself</p><p><span class="code">$git remote add origin https://github.com/moosehughes/MooseInvaders.git</span> and then <span class="code">$git push -u origin master</span> which pushes all file into your online repository.</p>
